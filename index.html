      <h5>Introduction, <span class="w3-opacity">January 13, 2023</span></h5>
    </div>

    <div class="w3-container">
      <p>Creative writing is a form of artistic expression, draws on the imagination to convey meaning through the use of imagery, narrative, and drama. This is in contrast to analytic or pragmatic forms of writing. Creative writing can for the most part be considered any writing that is original and self-expressive.</p>
      <p>The purpose of creative writing is to both entertain and share human experience, like love or loss. Writers attempt to get at a truth about humanity through poetics and storytelling. If you'd like to try your hand at creative writing, just keep in mind that whether you are trying to express a feeling or a thought, the first step is to use your imagination.</p>
      <p>Types of creative writing include: Poetry, Plays, Movie and TV Scripts, Fiction (Novels, Novellas, and Short Stories), Songs, Speeches, Memoirs, Personal Essays.</p>

      <h3><b>Personal Narrative</b></h3>
    </div>

    <div class="w3-container">
      <p>What is a personal narrative essay?</p>
        <p>A personal narrative essay is a story you choose to share with readers, for it communicates your understanding of yourself, others, and/or society. As people, we remember stories, so your personal narrative essay is a way you can transform an ordinary experience into meaningful commentary that is applicable to a broad audience.</p>
      <p>What questions can I consider to help me convey my story effectively?</p>
        <p>A personal narrative essay uses the components of a story: introduction, plot, characters, setting, and conflict. It also uses the components of argument, thesis, and conclusion. In a personal narrative essay, we tell our readers a story to make a larger argument. Focusing the readers’ attention on significant, detailed scenes, we develop our argument persuasively through effective storytelling.</p>

        <p>Lack of Something</p>
          <p>This situation has been stayed since the beginning of my college. Personally, the choice to continue school life to a higher level is a big choice. I know and understand that intellectual satisfaction is an inseparable part of human being. However, when i entered college, this satisfaction seemed to be messy by various unexpected things. Boredom, laziness and apathy often appear when I am in the classroom. This situation also surprised the lecturers who asked me several times with the question, "what's wrong with you, Dimas? You look confused and empty when you are in class.” I do not know what to answer but it would be better if I said “nothing happened mam/sir”. I also hope that it can make a stand until my graduation day will arrive later.</p>

        <h3><b>Writing Process</b></h3>
      </div>
  
      <div class="w3-container">
        <p>Step 1: Prewriting (Think and Decide)</p>
          <p>Make sure you understand your assignment. Decide on a topic to write about. See Prewriting Strategies and Narrow your Topic. Consider who will read your work. See Audience and Voice Brainstorm ideas about the subject and how those ideas can be organized. Make an outline.</p>
        <p>Step 2: Research (Search, If Needed)</p>
          <p>List places where you can find information. Evaluate your sources. See Evaluating Sources and Primary vs Secondary Sources. Make an outline to help organize your research.</p>
        <p>Step 3: Drafting (Write)</p>
          <p>Write sentences and paragraphs even if they are not perfect. Create a thesis statement with your main idea. Put the information you researched into your essay accurately without plagiarizing. Remember to include both in-text citations and a bibliographic page. Read what you have written and judge if it says what you mean. Write some more. Read it again. Write until you have said everything you want to say about the topic.</p>
        <p>Step 4: Revising (Make it Better)</p>
          <p>Read what you have written again. See Revising Content and Revising Organization.Rearrange words, sentences, or paragraphs into a clear and logical order. Take out or add parts. Do more research if you think you should. Replace overused or unclear words. Read your writing aloud to be sure it flows smoothly. Add transitions.</p>
        <p>Step 5: Editing and Proofreading (Make it Correct)</p>
          <p>Be sure all sentences are complete. See Editing and Proofreading Correct spelling, capitalization, and punctuation. Change words that are not used correctly or are unclear.</p>

      <h5>Ghera Gaharu Gamaliel, <span class="w3-opacity">October 12, 2022</span></h5>
      <p>The main image of the magazine cover is usually a representative illustration of the content within the magazine. It should best reflect what the issue is all about. Big magazines typically portray a well-known celebrity or a visually appealing image that easily triggers an emotion.</p>
      <p>1. Place the magazine name in the most obvious place. 2. Use the same cover template for all magazine issues. 3. Decide on a focus point and build everything else around it</p>

        <p>Be Proud of Who You Are.</p>
        <p>
          I come with no wrapping or pretty pink bows.
          I am who I am, from my head to my toes. 
          I tend to get loud when speaking my mind. Even a little crazy some of the time. 
          I'm not a size 5 and don't care to be. 
          You can be you and I can be me. 
          I try to stay strong when pain knocks me down. And the times that I cry are when no one's around. 
          To error is human or so that's what they say. Well, tell me who's perfect anyway.
          <p>Bermegahlah Terhadap Siapa Kamu</p>
          <p>Datang tanpa balutan dan kerlip merah muda adalah aku sendiri, dari kepala hingga kaki cenderung lantang ketika berbicara dikepala cenderung sedikit abnormal sesekali tak ideal dan aku tak perduli kau adalah kau, 
            aku adalah aku berjuang agar tetap tegar 
            bila mana pedih buat ku jatuh 
            waktu aku menangis saat tak sejiwapun di sekitarku 
            manusia tempatnya salah, setidaknya begitu ku diberitahu
            maka, beriku tau seorang yang cukup utuh</p></p>

        <span class="w3-large">The Language of TV and Radio</span><br>
        <span><p>Two important features of media production. First, television is a tech-nical medium and so we cannot interact with it or interject in the same way that we do in two-way ﬂow communication such as face-to-face conversation. Secondly, it is monological or mass communication,which means that it is not directed at speciﬁc individuals but is produced for an unlimited number of people. Like other media, television iscapable of multiple reproduction – one television programme can be seen by an unlimited number of people simultaneously</p></span>

        <span class="w3-large">True Life Story Writing</span><br>
        <span><p>Writing true-life stories is cathartic. The process is healing, and authors often say they come out of the experience feeling like they went through an intense therapy session. But digging deep to produce these nonfiction stories hurts too, especially if you focus on a traumatic experience</p></span>

        <span class="w3-large">Documentary Story</span><br>
        <span><p>Documentary filmmaking is a non-fiction form of storytelling involving real people, real issues and real-life situations. While lots of documentary projects are just as entertaining to watch as fictional films, they usually have a dual purpose: to educate or inform their audience or document a particular subject matter</p></span>

        <span><p>A screenplay is a written work for a film, television show, or other moving media, that expresses the movement, actions and dialogue of characters. Screenplays, or scripts, are the blueprint for the movie. A screenplay is written in a specific format to distinguish between characters, action lines, and dialogue</p></span>
